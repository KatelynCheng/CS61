# CS61
labs &amp; projects from UCR's CS61 - machine org &amp; assembly

These are all the labs and projects I completed when I took CS61 - Machine org & assembly - at UCR.
All code is written in LC-3 Assembly.
Each folder contains the project spec created by the instructor of the course, and my implemented solution.
